// Validates what prose cannot enforce:
//   1. artifact IDs (REQ/NFR/RISK/US/AC/SCR/ST/ADR) are unique across the repo
//   2. knowledge/traceability/manifest.json links resolve, bidirectionally —
//      every requirement a story cites must itself be a node in the graph
//   3. story AC lists in the manifest match the AC headings in the story files
//   4. listed test files exist and cite every AC of their story (US-###/AC-##)
//      in the title of an ACTIVE test — citations in comments or skipped tests
//      (it.skip/xit/describe.skip) are not proof. For a story IN DELIVERY
//      (branch feat/US-###-*), having no tests at all is an error, not a warning.
//      Both 3 and 4 read manifest.stories, so the reverse edge is checked too: a
//      story FILE with no manifest entry is a warning while it is being drafted
//      and an error once its branch is in delivery — otherwise it would escape
//      the AC->test gate entirely. A branch naming a story that has no file at
//      all is always an error
//   5. spec files citing a US are listed in that story's manifest entry (no stale manifest)
//   6. product projects (api, ui, graph-engine) declare a test target
//   7. traceability-matrix.md matches what the manifest generates (no hand edits)
//   8. knowledge-graph edges resolve: story decisions[] -> defined ADRs,
//      lessons[] entries are well-formed and link to real artifacts
//   9. the distributable plugin payload matches its sources
//      (tools/aidlc-build-plugin.mjs --check)
//  10. every persona has a charter + skill + agent that agree, and personas
//      with no authority to change things (architect, manager) are read-only
//      by tooling — their agent must disallow Write and Edit
//  12. Jira ticket templates parse, use only known placeholders, and declare no
//      field that would forward approval or duplicate what Jira owns. Recorded
//      ticket keys are well-formed. Jira is a tracking mirror, so a MISSING key
//      is never an error — Jira going away must not break the build.
//  11. design is enforced, not conventional: a story with a UI section cites a
//      screen; a screen's ST-## states match its manifest entry and are each
//      rendered+marked in one of its component previews; component previews
//      exist and contain no raw hex; inception/design/tokens.json is generated
//      from tokens.css (the designer's tool-agnostic export) and never hand-edited
//  13. the per-tool persona surfaces (Cursor, opencode, GitHub Copilot) match
//      their .claude/ sources (tools/aidlc-build-surfaces.mjs --check, ADR-005)
//  15. cross-repo e2e evidence (knowledge/traceability/e2e-coverage.json) is
//      validated when present and IGNORED when absent — a repo keeping its e2e
//      tests in-repo, or having none, is unaffected. It can never prove that a
//      remote assertion ran, only that the claim is well-formed and the criterion
//      exists, which is why a pass must carry the run it came from
//  16. a spec package present under inception/specs/ is internally honest:
//      every FR/NFR in spec.md has a traceability row, every cited path exists,
//      every US/AC it cites is real, it has an index row, and a Gate D1 approval
//      block is well-formed and matches the plan it approved. An ABSENT package
//      fails nothing — CI cannot know the tier, and Simple work has none.
//  14. framework-owned files match ai/framework-lock.json (SHA-256 per file).
//      Adopting teams edit only project-owned paths (ai/standards/,
//      ai/templates/jira/); an edited or deleted framework file fails the
//      build until reverted — framework changes go upstream as change requests
