## 1. Business goal

Provide a web application so employees at a single hybrid office can reserve a specific desk before coming in, and so administrators can oversee bookings, maintain desk inventory, and manage user accounts for the office.

## 2. Actors

| Actor    | Description                                      | Needs                                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Employee | Staff member who works hybrid and books a desk   | Sign in, book/view/cancel desks; receive booking emails; optionally enable browser push for book/cancel |
| Admin    | Office administrator                             | Sign in; view/cancel all bookings; manage desks and users; receive same booking emails when acting on behalf of employees where applicable |
| System   | Desk booking application                         | Enforce business rules; send email notifications; deliver opt-in browser push |

## 3. Workflows

1. **Employee books a desk:** Employee signs in → selects a date (today through +30 days, working day, office timezone) → views desks by unique number with availability → selects one available desk → booking is created with status **Confirmed**.
2. **Employee reviews bookings:** Employee opens own bookings list → sees past and future bookings with status → can cancel today or future **Confirmed** bookings → cancelled bookings become **Cancelled**.
3. **Employee changes desk:** Employee cancels the existing booking for that date → books a different available desk for the same date (no direct desk swap on an existing booking).
4. **Admin monitors bookings:** Admin signs in → views all bookings → filters by date and/or status → can cancel a **Confirmed** booking on behalf of an employee for today or a future date.
5. **Booking completes:** When a **Confirmed** booking date passes in office local time without cancellation, status becomes **Completed**.
6. **Admin manages desks:** Admin signs in → views desk inventory → adds a desk with a unique number → edits desk number (when allowed) → activates or deactivates desks → inactive desks are excluded from employee booking availability.
7. **Admin manages users:** Admin signs in → views user list → creates a user (email, role, initial credentials) → edits user details → assigns **Employee** or **Admin** role → deactivates users → resets a user's password (admin-initiated, not self-service).
8. **Booking notifications (email):** When a booking becomes **Confirmed** or **Cancelled**, the system sends an email to the employee who owns the booking. For each **Confirmed** booking on a future working day, the system sends a reminder email on the previous calendar day (office local timezone).
9. **Booking notifications (browser push, optional):** An Employee may opt in to browser push alerts. When opted in, the system sends a push notification on book and on cancel (employee-initiated or admin-initiated cancel of that employee's booking). Day-before reminders remain email only.

## 6. Business rules

### BR-001.1 One desk per employee per working day

- **Statement:** When an Employee attempts to create a booking, the system must reject the request if that Employee already has a **Confirmed** booking for the same calendar date (office local timezone).
- **Rationale:** Prevents double-booking and matches hybrid office policy of one seat per person per day.
- **Examples:** Pass — Employee with no booking on 2026-08-20 books desk A-01. Fail — Employee with **Confirmed** booking on 2026-08-20 attempts to book desk B-02 the same date.
- **Affects:** REQ-008

### BR-001.2 Change desk by cancel-then-book

- **Statement:** When an Employee wants a different desk on a date they already booked, the system must require cancellation of the existing **Confirmed** booking before a new booking for that date can be created.
- **Rationale:** Client chose explicit cancel-then-book over in-place desk changes.
- **Examples:** Pass — Employee cancels A-01 for Tuesday, then books B-02 for Tuesday. Fail — Employee attempts to change A-01 to B-02 on the same booking record without cancelling.
- **Affects:** REQ-008, REQ-010

### BR-001.3 Working-day booking window

- **Statement:** When an Employee or Admin selects or creates a booking date, the system must allow only Monday–Friday dates; Saturday and Sunday are not bookable.
- **Rationale:** Hybrid office operates on standard working days; weekends are out of scope for booking.
- **Examples:** Pass — booking created for a Wednesday. Fail — booking attempted for a Saturday within the +30-day window.
- **Affects:** REQ-006, REQ-008

### BR-001.4 Unique desk numbers

- **Statement:** When desks are presented for booking, each desk must display a unique identifier in the form of an alphanumeric desk number (e.g. A-01, B-02, C-05).
- **Rationale:** Employees choose a specific desk; labels must be unambiguous.
- **Examples:** Pass — availability list shows "A-01" and "B-02" as distinct selectable desks. Fail — two desks share the same displayed number.
- **Affects:** REQ-007, REQ-008

### BR-001.5 Booking status lifecycle

- **Statement:** Every booking must be in exactly one status: **Confirmed** (active future or current-day reservation), **Cancelled** (voided before use), or **Completed** (the booking date has passed without cancellation).
- **Rationale:** Admin filtering and reporting depend on a shared status vocabulary agreed with the client.
- **Examples:** Pass — past **Confirmed** booking automatically shown as **Completed** after the date. Fail — booking remains **Confirmed** indefinitely after the date passes.
- **Affects:** REQ-009, REQ-011, REQ-012, REQ-013

### BR-001.6 Cancellation eligibility

- **Statement:** When a user (Employee or Admin) attempts to cancel a booking, the system must allow cancellation only if the booking date is today or in the future (office local timezone) and the current status is **Confirmed**; past-date **Confirmed** or **Completed** bookings cannot be cancelled.
- **Rationale:** Aligns employee and admin cancellation rules from client clarification.
- **Examples:** Pass — Admin cancels Employee's booking for tomorrow. Fail — Employee cancels a booking dated yesterday.
- **Affects:** REQ-010, REQ-014

### BR-001.7 Inactive desks excluded from booking

- **Statement:** When a desk is **Inactive**, the system must exclude it from employee availability for all dates and must reject new bookings against that desk.
- **Rationale:** Deactivation retires a desk from the bookable pool without deleting history.
- **Examples:** Pass — Employee availability list shows only **Active** desks. Fail — Employee books an **Inactive** desk.
- **Affects:** REQ-007, REQ-008, REQ-017

### BR-001.8 Desk number uniqueness on create and edit

- **Statement:** When an Admin adds or edits a desk, the system must reject duplicate desk numbers (case-normalized comparison per implementation).
- **Rationale:** BR-001.4 requires unambiguous desk identifiers.
- **Examples:** Pass — Admin adds A-12 when A-12 does not exist. Fail — Admin adds A-12 when A-12 already exists.
- **Affects:** REQ-015, REQ-016, BR-001.4

### BR-001.9 Deactivate desk with future bookings

- **Statement:** When an Admin deactivates a desk that has one or more **Confirmed** bookings for today or a future date, the system must block deactivation until those bookings are cancelled or the Admin explicitly cancels them as part of the deactivate action.
- **Rationale:** Prevents employees holding reservations on desks removed from service without notice.
- **Examples:** Pass — Admin deactivates B-03 with no future **Confirmed** bookings. Fail — Admin deactivates B-03 while a **Confirmed** booking exists for next Tuesday unless that booking is cancelled in the same flow.
- **Affects:** REQ-017, REQ-014

### BR-001.10 User email uniqueness

- **Statement:** When an Admin creates or edits a user, the system must reject duplicate email addresses across all accounts.
- **Rationale:** Email is the sign-in identifier (REQ-002).
- **Examples:** Pass — Admin creates `jane@company.com` when unused. Fail — Admin creates a second account with the same email.
- **Affects:** REQ-018, REQ-019

### BR-001.11 Last active Admin safeguard

- **Statement:** When an Admin attempts to deactivate an account or change a role such that zero **Admin** users would remain active, the system must reject the action.
- **Rationale:** Prevents locking the organization out of admin functions.
- **Examples:** Pass — Two active Admins; one is deactivated. Fail — Only one active Admin remains and that account is deactivated.
- **Affects:** REQ-020, REQ-022

### BR-001.12 Admin password reset delivery

- **Statement:** When an Admin resets a user's password, the system must set a new password and display it once to the Admin in the application (copy-to-clipboard encouraged); the system must not email the password to the user unless a separate requirement is approved.
- **Rationale:** REQ-021 is admin-initiated; email delivery is not assumed (notifications open question #3).
- **Examples:** Pass — Admin resets password; new temporary value shown once on screen. Fail — Password change with no feedback to the Admin performing the reset.
- **Affects:** REQ-021

### BR-001.13 Mandatory booking emails

- **Statement:** When a booking transitions to **Confirmed** or **Cancelled**, the system must send the corresponding email (REQ-023, REQ-024) to the booking owner's account email without requiring user opt-in.
- **Rationale:** Email is the primary notification channel agreed for this release.
- **Examples:** Pass — Employee books desk A-01; confirmation email sent. Fail — Booking confirmed with no email attempted.
- **Affects:** REQ-023, REQ-024

### BR-001.14 Day-before reminder email

- **Statement:** When a **Confirmed** booking date is a future working day (Mon–Fri, office local timezone), the system must send one reminder email on the previous calendar day; no reminder is sent for same-day bookings or for **Cancelled**/**Completed** bookings.
- **Rationale:** Reduces no-shows; "day-before" defined in office local time per client request.
- **Examples:** Pass — **Confirmed** booking for Wed 20 Aug; reminder sent Tue 19 Aug (office TZ). Fail — Reminder sent for a **Cancelled** booking.
- **Affects:** REQ-025, BR-001.3, NFR-001

### BR-001.15 Browser push opt-in only

- **Statement:** Browser push for book/cancel events must be disabled until the Employee explicitly opts in (REQ-026); opting out must stop subsequent push notifications without affecting email notifications.
- **Rationale:** Push is optional per client request; email remains the reliable channel.
- **Examples:** Pass — Employee enables push; receives push on next booking. Fail — Push sent to Employee who never opted in.
- **Affects:** REQ-026, REQ-027

### BR-001.16 Push scope excludes reminders

- **Statement:** Day-before reminder notifications must be delivered by email only; browser push must not be used for reminders in this release.
- **Rationale:** Client specified push for book/cancel only.
- **Examples:** Pass — Reminder email sent; no push for reminder. Fail — Push notification for day-before reminder.
- **Affects:** REQ-025, REQ-027

## 8. Constraints

- Single office location only (no multi-site routing or selection).
- Email/password authentication only; no SSO or social login in this release.
- Desk inventory and user accounts are maintained in-app by Admins (REQ-015–REQ-022); initial bootstrap of the first Admin account: **`DbInitializer` seed when no users exist** (PO/Architect, 2026-08-21).
- Company public holidays are not yet defined in scope — until resolved, only weekend exclusion (BR-001.3) is guaranteed.

## 9. Risks

| ID       | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| -------- | ---- | ---------- | ------ | ---------- |
| RISK-001 | Admin provisioning expands delivery surface (CRUD, validation, audit). | Medium | Medium | UX designs SCR-005/SCR-006; Architect addresses data model; slice stories after design merge. |
| RISK-002 | Holiday calendar undefined — employees may book on company holidays. | Medium | Medium | Resolve open question #2; interim Mon–Fri rule documented in BR-001.3. |
| RISK-003 | No self-service password reset; employees depend on Admin for password help. | Medium | Low | REQ-021 admin reset; self-service remains out of scope per §10. |
| RISK-004 | Concurrent booking of the same desk could cause double-booking without proper locking. | Low | High | Address in architecture/delivery (not a BA design decision). |
| RISK-005 | Admin displays new password on screen — shoulder-surfing / log exposure if mishandled. | Low | Medium | Show once + copy; UX warning copy; no password in persistent audit log. |
| RISK-006 | Email delivery failures (wrong address, SMTP outage) leave users uninformed. | Medium | Medium | Log failures (NFR-005); operational monitoring; valid email on user create (REQ-018). |
| RISK-007 | Browser push permission denied or unsupported — user expects alerts. | Medium | Low | Clear UX that push is optional; email always sent (BR-001.13). |

## 10. Out of scope

- Forgot-password / **self-service** password reset (client confirmed for current stage). Admin-initiated reset is **in scope** (REQ-021).
- Email delivery of **passwords** or **admin account credentials** (separate from booking transactional email).
- SMS or mobile-app push notifications.
- Browser push for day-before reminders (email only per BR-001.16).
- User opt-out of mandatory booking emails (emails on book/cancel/reminder are always sent per REQ-023–REQ-025).
- Booking more than one desk per employee per day.
- In-place desk swap without cancellation.
- Multi-office or multi-location support.
- Weekend desk booking (Saturday/Sunday).
- Visitor desk booking on behalf of others by Employees (one desk per employee per day only).
