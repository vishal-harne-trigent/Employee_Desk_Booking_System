# Spec index

Every development spec package in this repo. **Check here before creating a new folder** — the capability may already have one, and a change to it is a revision of that package, not a second spec.

## How to update

- Add a row when you create `inception/specs/US-###-<slug>/` (DEV, at Gate D1)
- Move Status to `implemented` when the story PR merges
- Simple-tier changes own no folder — they record one row in `_change-log.md` instead
